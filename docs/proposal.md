## Summary

Our goal for this project is to train an agent to search for cows and shoot them with a bow and arrow from a distance. 

- stretch goals: look for bow/arrow
- add penalty/restriction for missing e.g. long reload speed

input: agent position, cows position (xyz)
output: bow and arrow angle, power, agent direction, hit boolean

Applications: Malmo

## AI/ML Algorithms

Reinforcement Learning?

## Evaluation Plan

Quantitative Eval:
Metrics: Number of shots taken, time taken, number of dead cows
Baselines: 5 minutes
How much will our approach improve: some number of kills
Data: Time, Cows 

Qualitative Eval:
Sanity Cases: being able to shoot (fire arrow), looking in different directions?, detect cow, detect and kill 1 cow.
Visualize algo internals: error chart/graph
Moonshot Case: 100% accuracy/ kill all cows
